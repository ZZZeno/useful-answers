### what is draft PR, when & how convert a PR to a draft PR
1. if a pull request was opened in a non-draft state by mistake.
2. when a pull request is reviewed and needs additional work; converting the pull request to a draft communicates the pull request is being updated.
3. when a pull request is reviewed and approved but the author wants to block merge for other reasons.
